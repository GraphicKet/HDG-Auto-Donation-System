### Description:
HDG Auto Donation System is an innovation in Garry's Mod auto-donation systems. Provided free, this software is designed to suit almost any GMOD community, and their individual needs for donation processing.

Despite being in a very early stage of development, this system is supposed to fit all sizes. Whether you run a top ranking Garry's Mod community with 50 odd servers with several gamemodes and voice servers, or just host a single DarkRP server, this donation system is designed to work for your needs.

This system currently contains the following features.

* Unlimited number of servers to connect to.
* An unlimited number of packages to choose from.
* A customizable email alert system. (It's a html formatted email too)
* A handy "Login with Steam" button.
* Fully customizable and configurable forum integration system, which comes pre-equipped with configurations for Simple Machine Forums and MyBB.
* A quick and easy to use TeamSpeak 3 promotion system.
* Database donation logging
* Donation Verification
* Physical verbose logging.

Future planned features:

* Compatibility with different payment processors. (Other than PayPal).
* Multiple TeamSpeak servers
* Multiple Voice server types.
* Compatibility with more package types (DarkRP money, Server Ranks, etc etc)
* And lots more!

This donation system is an official product of Higher Dimensions Gaming.
